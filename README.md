roms2cf
=======

These Matlab scripts convert Regional Ocean Modelling System output files to CF complaint

These scripts are intended for the AGRIF version of the model

Whereas roms2cf.m directly converts the file, roms2cf_geoptential.m creates outputs at different z-levels. 
See http://centolo.co.ieo.es:8080/thredds/catalog/ROMS-IEO/catalog.html as an example of I am talking about.
